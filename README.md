**Our Project**

We have developed a web-based application that helps farmers to select crops that are compatible with their current crops and soil conditions. The application takes into account a variety of factors, including the type of crop, the soil type, and the climate. It then recommends a crop rotation pattern that will help to maintain soil fertility and productivity


Our project, CROPIO, taps into this market opportunity, offering a crop rotation recommender tool that has the potential to revolutionize sustainable farming practices. With over 500 million farmers worldwide actively seeking ways to improve their productivity and reduce environmental impact, we have a vast customer base to target.


**Benefits**

Our crop rotation recommender can help farmers to:

- Reduce soil depletion
- Improve soil health
- Reduce the need for pesticides and fertilizers
- Increase crop yields
- Save money on farming costs

  **Conclusion**

We believe that our crop rotation recommender can be a valuable tool for farmers who are looking to improve the sustainability of their operations. By helping farmers to select crops that are compatible with their current crops and soil conditions, we can help to reduce soil depletion, improve soil health, and increase crop yields.
